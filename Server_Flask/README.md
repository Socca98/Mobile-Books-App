the community edition.
Then go to the installed folder /bin and double click mongodb. Now you have a server running in the background.
Functions using the db in python will work now.


[Installing MongoDB package into python]
Install MongoDB using ALT+ENTER on the import.
Or with pip command in the terminal.

That will install the package globally. 
Where your pip (python.exe) is installed on your computer.

You can create a virtual environment for this python app, 
go into the virtual environment and 
install the packages only in project's folder (locally). 

The VE is used in real world application so you import only the packages 
that you need for one app. And other reasons I don't know ..
